# Organic Growth

The aforementioned use cases, namely (a) smart contracts, (b) digital identifiers, and (c) asset tokenization are large verticals by themselves with plenty of organic growth opportunities. We can focus on client acquisition and deepening our share-of-wallet in these verticals at this early stage without constantly expanding into new areas.

The strategy is to build up our strengths and performance in our core product offering, and to do it really well! Eventually we can build on these core strengths and market confidence to expand into various other applications easily, as illustrated in the Blocktopus schematic below (by Deloitte UK).

Change will always be difficult, however there is no stopping technology growth. As we progress into a more eco-friendly and fast paced development in the trading business, there should be a step-by-step approach in adapting the blockchain technology so as to not completely ignore the traditional methods (i.e., paperwork) as there will be different views from various countries, organizations as well as users. The implementation guide from choosing an interoperable technology to going 100% digital will indeed take time and not to be rushed for the sake of using the services but focused on embracing blockchain technology in day-to-day operations.
