# Pilot 2A: Digital Identity

Blockchain enables more secure management and storage of digital identities by providing unified, interoperable, and tamper-proof infrastructure with crucial benefits to enterprises, users, and IoT management systems. Digital identity is a type of identity where an individual’s identity is represented through digital means – efficient in curbing online frauds, including identity theft, financial scams, and money laundering. Digital identity comes into existence organically from personal information and data generated by an individual’s online activity – usernames and passwords, drivers licence number, online purchasing history, online search activities, medical history – which leaves a digital footprint.

Besides that, blockchain-based mobile identity solutions support vulnerable individuals’ needs. It addresses the inaccessibility of obtaining an identity and the basic needs that come with it. The inconvenience of identification paperwork processes, expenses and poor access are primary roadblocks that keep over a billion individuals outside of traditional identification systems – especially refugees and unqualified migrant workers . Without possessing a physical identity, an individual will face trouble in gaining access to basic necessities – education, job or other governmental services.

Moreover, obtaining an identity is crucial to gain access to the existing financial system. Public and private sectors worldwide understand the need to develop comprehensive ID programs, which will enable access to financial services and other services. Furthermore, e-commerce and IoT have shown the need for verifiable digital identities not only for people but also for legal commodities. Therefore, the interoperability of digital IDs across borders can accelerate economic integration and create opportunities for new markets. For example, the design of Thailand's digital ID platform is to support other ASEAN nationals where they can authenticate themselves for online transactions with businesses and government agencies based in Thailand.
