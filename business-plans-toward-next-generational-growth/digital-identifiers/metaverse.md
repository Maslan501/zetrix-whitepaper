# Metaverse

The metaverse can be defined as an immersive 3D space that consolidates multiple AR, VR, and MR experiences to create a converged environment where users can interact with each other and the 3D world around them.&#x20;

The metaverse has been a long time in the making, since the rise of games like Second Life. Early platforms such as Second Life and Minecraft demonstrated that you could have an alternate virtual reality where you can exist as a 3D replica of yourself, going through experiences, emotions, transactions, and interactions similar to the real world.&#x20;

More recently the industry’s development direction emphasizes human-computer interaction (HCI). You can now not only exist in a 3D avatar form, but you could also engage in sensory interactions with the virtual world-scape.&#x20;

In future, the multiple metaverse platforms would come together to form a converged environment – i.e., the true metaverse.&#x20;

Zetrix will work with a network of partners including games, AR and VR developers to realise a series of platforms from 2D games, digital asset driven games and lead toward fully immersive virtual experiences.
