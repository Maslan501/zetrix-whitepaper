# Product Roadmap

Zetrix is developed by a well-established IT group (MYEG) which is a successful late-stage innovator with a proven track record of product development, tech experience curve, and multinational presence.

Our initial target market will be to the strategic priority sectors in Phase 1 and 2 (see below). These are at the industry level that require cross-functional participation and upfront investment, and are expected to take a relatively longer gestation period due to its nature and complexity. Nevertheless the competitive advantages acquired will be entrenched and with long term benefits for us.

We are uniquely positioned, due to our technical expertise and strategic investments, to deploy the product roadmap for these priority sectors between Malaysia and China. It bears repeating that Zetrix’s products have been showcased during the MOU signing with CAICT (under China’s Ministry of Industry & Information Technology) which was inaugurated by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) of Malaysia in 2021, as well as at the Malaysia Pavilion in Expo 2020 Dubai.

For the broader small-to-medium enterprise (SME) segment, which make up the vast majority of ASEAN’s GDP growth engine, our objective is to introduce these blockchain tech products in the form of Traceability-as-a-Service (TaaS) software, which will be monthly subscription-based, modularised, and delivered online with easy plug-and-play usage. This enables much easier market penetration and scalability, akin to a cloud-based data storage service.

The international supply chain is growing in complexity at the same time as nation states seek to improve their border compliance for imports and facilitate access to export markets for their domestic producers.

Zetrix has developed Ztrade as the next-generation trade connectivity platform that utilizes blockchain technology and document digitization to save time, minimizes human error, making Malaysia a leader in technology innovation within the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).

Zetrix has also introduced ZTradeFi, an innovative blockchain powered trade financing solution that elevates cross-border trading to new heights. Our cutting-edge platform simplifies complex cross-border trading processes and creates new opportunities for local businesses to seamlessly and securely connect with Chinese counterparties, enabling cross-border financial and trade connectivity.

Blockchain technology can help solve issued faced by the traditional way of international trading namely:

* Cost of trade
* Allowing SMEs to participate instead of big corporations only
* Eliminate/reducing fake goods transactions
* Environmental issues like carbon emissions
* Managing border risks based on data integrity
* Importance of digitization
* Traceability through supply chain
* Automated compliance and risk

The above issues have been highlighted in the eDATA Verifiable Credentials for Cross Border Trade whitepaper in September 2022. The importance of blockchain technology highlights the need to further improve trading facilities whilst keeping in abreast with the ever-growing technology of today.
