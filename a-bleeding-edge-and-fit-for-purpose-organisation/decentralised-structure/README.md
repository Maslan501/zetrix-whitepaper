# Decentralised Structure

We have a formal mechanism for ZETRIX Token holders to influence the decision-making process for Zetrixâ€™s public blockchains and determine its future through on-chain governance. It is worth noting that decentralisation is not a one-size-fits-all approach and the structure put in place needs to be practical and is fit for its intended purpose. In our case, there are no treasuries, yield farms or liquidity pools involved. ZETRIX Coins are being used to power up the blockchain and validate transactions without risk of double-spending.

For child chains or subchains of Zetrix which are operated by independent nodes for a particular industrial setting, the nodes need to reach an agreement by way of DPoS consensus as discussed earlier. If they do not, the network may temporarily halt and need to resolve disputes to arrive at the final version of the validated ledger. Each node plays an integral role and there is no undue reliance on one or the other in the economic relationship.
