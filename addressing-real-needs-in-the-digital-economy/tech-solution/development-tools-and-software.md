# Development Tools & Software

Zetrix blockchain is built with developers in mind. As such, tools have been developed to ensure that developers will be able to build, test and deploy their applications onto the Zetrix blockchain without hiccups.&#x20;

Traditionally, there are considerably high hurdles and learning curves associated with creating blockchain applications. Zetrix addresses these challenges by providing the necessary tools such as SDKs (iOS, PHP, Node, Java), APIs (REST), sandbox environments, and IDEs along with familiar development frameworks such as V8. The developer can seamlessly deploy their application from the IDE to the Zetrix blockchain VM.

Other quality of life tools include blockchain explorers and network health monitor and trust verification tools. These items round up the Zetrix ecosystem as an all encompassing blockchain project.

All these allows developers to spend less time learning and more time creating, which coincidentally reduces the costs related to acquiring new technologies.
