# Zetrix Blockchain

The Zetrix blockchain will exist as a public blockchain smart contract platform which serves all international markets outside China.

MYEG is also collaborating with the Institute of Industrial Internet and Internet of Things of the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) to implement the Zetrix blockchain as the extension of the Xinghuo BIF outside of China .

Supernodes for the Zetrix blockchain will be connected to the Xinghuo BIF chain via Xinghuoâ€™s overseas supernode hosted by MYEG that is serving global businesses. Both the MYEG Xinghuo supernode and the Zetrix supernode will be connected via inter-chain protocols, which will allow Zetrix to communicate not only with the Xinghuo BIF chain, but also other participants connected to the Xinghuo BIF.
