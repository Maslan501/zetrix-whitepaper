# Staking & Validators

Nodes are groups that are capable of running a full Zetrix node. Running a node is hardware and network intensive, and a substantial amount of infrastructure investment is required. The nodes keep the network alive by keeping a record of all the transactions and serve as backups in case other nodes experience downtime. Each node will be required to stake at least 100,000 ZETRIX before they are allowed to validate blocks and transactions.

Once operational, nodes are voted in as approved nodes by a 2/3 majority vote of the validating nodes committee. There is no hard limit to the number of approved nodes on the network.

On a daily basis, the consensus algorithm will randomly delegate 21 nodes from the total pool of approved nodes available on the Zetrix Network to validate the next block, herein referred to as validator nodes.&#x20;

For example, suppose the total number of approved nodes is 221,  in the initial 4 years of Zetrix’s lifecycle. In that case, 21 validator nodes will be chosen daily to validate new blocks every 10s and distribute the reward of 44 ZETRIX equally across the 221 approved nodes. Hence, each node receives approximately 0.2 ZETRIX as a reward for each new block mined.&#x20;

Zetrix holders may also participate in the staking mechanism. The minimum amount of ZETRIX staked by a holder is 1 ZETRIX and the maximum amount of ZETRIX staked to a validating node is 100,000 ZETRIX.

The size of the stake is proportionate to the share of block rewards received. If a holder stakes ZETRIX that amount to 10% in the pool, the holder receives 10% of the rewards received by the pool, minus fees. The pool also receives a proportional amount of reward, based on the size of the pools.

For example a ZETRIX holder A stakes into pool X. Holder A stake about 10% of pool X’s size.  That means that holder A will receive approximately 0.1 \* reward received by pool X for every block holder A stakes in.

To prevent abuse, there are a few stages to staking. When staked, there will be a confirmation period. Once confirmed, the staked ZETRIX will be eligible to receive staking rewards.&#x20;

This structure allows the individual holders to contribute to the network’s validation protocols and simultaneously benefit from the staking rewards.
