# Staking & Validators

Nodes are groups that are capable of running a full Zetrix node. Running a node is hardware and network intensive, and a substantial amount of infrastructure investment is required. The nodes keep the network alive by keeping a record of all the transactions and serve as backups in case other nodes experience downtime. Each node will be required to stake at least 100,000 ZETRIX before they are allowed to validate blocks and transactions.

Once operational, nodes are voted in as approved nodes by a 2/3 majority vote of the validating nodes committee. There is no hard limit to the number of approved nodes on the network.

On a daily basis, the consensus algorithm will randomly delegate 21 nodes from the total pool of approved nodes available on the Zetrix Network to validate the next block, herein referred to as validator nodes.&#x20;

The block rewards obtained from the validation process will be distributed equally to all approved nodes on the network. For example, suppose the total number of approved nodes is 221, in the initial 4 years of Zetrixâ€™s lifecycle. In that case, 21 validator nodes will be chosen daily to validate new blocks every 10s and distribute the reward of 44 ZETRIX equally across the 221 approved nodes. Hence, each node receives approximately 0.2 ZETRIX as a reward for each new block mined.
