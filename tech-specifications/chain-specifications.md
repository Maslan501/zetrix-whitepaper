# Chain Specifications

Zetrix has a maximum supply of 2.1 billion ZETRIX, where 1 billion ZETRIX has already been minted for the genesis block. Block rewards will be awarded to validator nodes once the chain is live. The blocktime for the Zetrix chain is 10 seconds in the event that there are transactions of the blockchain that require validation. The blocktime will increase to 60 seconds should there be no transactions. The first block reward will award 44 ZETRIX to all approved nodes on the ZETRIX network. Block rewards will undergo a halving event every 4 years (or approximately 12.6 million blocks), in a similar fashion to Bitcoin. There is a minimum staking amount of 100,000 ZETRIX needed to be eligible to participate in the Node Validating Programme.
