# DPoS

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is a consensus algorithm developed to secure a blockchain by ensuring the representation of transactions within it. DPoS is designed as an implementation of technology-based democracy, using voting and election processes to protect the blockchain from centralisation and malicious usage.

A high-performance consensus algorithm requires the validating nodes to have high-performance servers and a stable operating environment. Ensuring the security of the validating nodes requires a unique mechanism to improve the security feature of the algorithm.

Therefore, Zetrix generates validating nodes through the DPoS mechanism. After ordinary nodes pledge a certain amount of ZETRIX tokens, they will be approved by the consensus committee. When in the verification node pool, once it is discovered that the node does not generate a block for a long period or sends out malicious consensus messages, the pledged tokens may be slashed through a punishment mechanism, and the qualification of the verification node can be cancelled. The voting mechanism is implemented based on the chainâ€™s desired form of governance.

The Zetrix DPoS mechanism is implemented through smart contracts, with a dynamic upgrade mechanism that can adjust to the difficulty of validating node access due to the growth of the Zetrix network. Moreover, DPoS uses minimal resources to keep the network running compared to other consensus mechanisms. It is a lot more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly, which will help Zetrix comply with ESG requirements.
