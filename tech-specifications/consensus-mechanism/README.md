# Consensus Mechanism

Consensus mechanism is the method that transactions are validated and subsequently added to the blockchain.&#x20;

The Zetrix blockchain offers an innovative consensus algorithm Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) and Zetrix Byzantine Fault Tolerance (zBFT), which supports large-scale nodes and high-speed transaction to participate in the consensus process. The high performance and consistency features of Zetrix, makes the chain suitable for various commercial application designs.&#x20;

Based on the DPOS mechanism, ordinary nodes pledge ZETRIX tokens to enter the validating node-set. The set of validating nodes then randomly selects 21 validating nodes to generate blocks in a cyclical rotation through the zBFT algorithm. Validators are voted in via a validator contract. Hence, this allows the chain to maintain high transaction speeds while ensuring decentralisation and security.
