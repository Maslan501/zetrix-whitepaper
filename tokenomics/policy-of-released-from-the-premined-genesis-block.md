# Policy of released from the premined Genesis block

Zetrix’s executive team will from time to time review the discretionary release schedule of the genesis block, in part or cumulatively to balance the market liquidity, operational demand by dapps on Zetrix’s network and strategic focuses such as opening new geographic markets for dapp adoption and/or new channels and platforms.
