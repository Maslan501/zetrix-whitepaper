2. Subscribers shall have a period of 14 calendar days (or cooling off period) to withdraw their agreement to purchase such digital assets without incurring any cost (except for the necessary gas fees) and without giving reasons. The period of withdrawal shall begin from the day of the subscriber’s agreement to purchase the digital assets.&#x20;

5. The right of withdrawal shall not apply where the digital assets are admitted to trading on a trading platform for crypto-assets.&#x20;
6. Where the issuer has set a time limit on its offer to the public of such digital assets, the right of withdrawal shall not be exercised after the end of the subscription period.&#x20;

## Right of Redress&#x20;

1. Subscribers shall be able to lodge a complaint with the issuer directly if there is any negligent misstatement, misrepresentation, defalcation, or fraudulent conduct, by an agent, officer, employee or representative of the issuer.&#x20;
