# Deflationary Actions

There will be deflationary policy actions for ZETRIX Coins. Excess ZETRIX (from the Strategic Reserve) will be progressively removed from circulation through buybacks if certain milestones are met. All buybacks will be announced beforehand, in conjunction with quarterly guidance or at the discretion of Zetrix management, and all records of such buybacks will be publicly viewable on the Zetrix block explorer.

Additionally, there will be programmed halving of the block rewards every 4 years similar to Bitcoin, please refer to the Block Rewards & Total Supply section above.
