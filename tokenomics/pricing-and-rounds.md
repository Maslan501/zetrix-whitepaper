# Pricing and Rounds

ZETRIX coin sale events are open to up to three categories of legal persons:&#x20;

1. **Private subscribers** refer to individuals who have the sufficient financial means and mental capability to make an informed decision on this purchase, and are generally considered to be qualified, sophisticated or accredited.&#x20;
2. **Enterprise subscribers** refer to body corporates which may include institutional and anchor investors, or the consortium members of Zetrix’s permissioned chains.&#x20;
3. **Public subscribers** refer to individuals who wish to participate in this largely private offering and are already, or likely to be, end users of Zetrix’s product suite.

There are several rounds leading up to the digital asset sale launch:

1. **Cornerstone round** for large subscriptions by strategic parties which are expected to boost the value and credibility of the Zetrix network.&#x20;
2. **Private round** for early advocates and evangelists of this project who place subscriptions, with preferential terms given in return for their early support.
3. **Pre-listing round** for subscribers who come in during the price discovery stage.&#x20;
4. **Public round** for interested subscribers when the offer and communications are out in the open. It is not marketed or sold to the general public.

Each fundraising round and respective pricing of the round will be announced by the Issuer to interested parties as and when requested.

Secondary trading and liquidity will mainly be via centralised and decentralised exchanges and where necessary unless otherwise organically developed by the community, Zetrix will develop tokens to ensure interoperability and/or commercial viability of liquidity via supported exchanges.
