# Digital Identifiers

Zetrix believes that the web3 future will not only benefit but fundamentally depend on digital identifiers, especially to bridge real world and virtual goods, services and identity.

Zetrix has developed token standards to enable (i) public utility and (ii) private use case tokenisation starting with the mass market adoption of NFTs up to the development of a native metaverse and later interconnected multiverse.
