# Pilot 2B: Vehicle Registration

Given our core competency in the processing of vehicle licence and road tax renewals, we have also made plans for the tokenization of registered car plates as non-fungible tokens (NFT). The motorist or vehicle owner will receive an official NFT certification, which provides digital proof of ownership, in addition to the normal documentation. Eventually this can be transferred to or traded with other vehicle owners via a designated and approved platform.
