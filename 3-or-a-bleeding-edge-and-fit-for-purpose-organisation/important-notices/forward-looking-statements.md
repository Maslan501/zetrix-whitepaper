# Forward-Looking Statements

This White Paper contains forward-looking statements on ZETRIX Coins including the future financial performance, expectations or estimates for fees, costs and expenses, and objectives of the Issuer. These forward-looking statements are typically identified by terminology such as “may”, “will”, “aim”, “target”, “should”, “expect”, “anticipates”, “intends”, “believes”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “projects”, “predicts”, “seeks”, “potential”, “continue” or other similar terminology. However, these terms are not the exclusive means of identifying forward-looking statements.

All statements regarding Zetrix’s financial position, business strategies, plans and prospects and the future prospects of the industry which Zetrix is in are forward-looking statements. All statements contained in the White Paper, including statements made in the Issuer’s website that are accessible by the public, press releases and oral statements made by Zetrix or Zetrix Representatives (as the case may be) that are not statements of historical fact, constitute “forward looking statements”.

Forward-looking statements are inherently unreliable, and prospective purchasers of ZETRIX Coins should not place undue reliance on them. The forward-looking statements are based on imperfect assumptions and projections about future events, which have not been audited. The actual results are subject to numerous risks, conditions, and uncertainties that could differ materially from those expressed in a forward-looking statement as a result of factors such as those described in the “Risk Warnings” section.

Zetrix does not have any obligation to update or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this White Paper or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Zetrix makes no representation or warranty on having made any predictions or estimates or expectations on the basis of any formula, any mathematical or scientific modelling or forecast, or having made any due and proper enquiries or having undertaken any independent research or studies or otherwise. The forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that include, amongst others:

1. Changes in political, social, economic and stock or cryptocurrency market conditions, and regulatory environment in the countries in which Zetrix conducts business and operations;
2. Changes in interest rates and exchange rates of fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies;
3. Changes in the anticipated growth strategies and expected internal growth of Zetrix;
4. Changes in the availability and services fees payable to Zetrix in connection with its business and operations;
5. Changes in the availability and salaries of employees who are required by Zetrix to operate its business and operations;
6. Changes in preferences of customers of Zetrix; changes in competitive conditions under which Zetrix operates, and the ability of Zetrix to compete under such conditions;
7. Changes in the future capital needs of Zetrix and the availability of financing and capital to fund such needs;
8. War or acts of international or domestic terrorism; occurrences of catastrophic events,
9. Natural disasters and acts of God that affect the businesses and/or operations of Zetrix;
10. Other factors beyond the exclusive control of Zetrix,
11. Risk that Zetrix is unable to execute or implement its business strategies and future plans; and
12. Any risk and uncertainties associated with Zetrix and its business and operations, the digital assets and reliance on all or any part of the White Paper.

All forward-looking statements made by or which are attributable to Zetrix or Zetrix Representatives are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors above.
